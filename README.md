# README

We would like you to build a Question and Answer application meant for internal use. The application doesnâ€™t need styling, but it should be functional according to the following specifications:

-	Users can submit questions
-	Users can submit answers to questions
-	Questions can be searched by title, and body (you can ignore answers)

We would also like for you to submit a short write up of the project and include unit tests. Please make sure you have the usual business logic so you check for blank fields etc and handle 404's etc in a graceful manner i.e. a simple standard error page saying we are looking into the problem is fine.

You can use SQLite or another database if your choice.


1. Create base app with rails new _app_name_
2. Generate User scaffold
3. Generate Question scaffold
4. Generate Answer scaffold
